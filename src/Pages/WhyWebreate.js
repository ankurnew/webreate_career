        The internet has the most significant impact on the global economy, and
        no business is immune to the internet's powerful world. Businesses
        require growth, and growth is insufficient without digitization. As the
        internet evolves, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up to date,
        as it is both time-consuming and cost-effective.
        <br />
